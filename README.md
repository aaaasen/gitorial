This repository contains a few tutorials on the basics of git, github and the command line. In the future I may add github for windows tutorials if necessary.

All of the tutorials are meant for people totally new to version control. I try to make them very visual and engaging and as a result, they don't have quite enough written information to be used  by themselves. I'll make sure to create a text cheat sheet to cover the holes in the presentations.
