In the future I may add github for windows tutorials if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll of the tutorials are meant for people totally new to version control. I try to make them very visual and engaging and as a result, they don't have quite enough written information to be used  by themselves. I'll make sure to create a text cheat sheet to cover the holes in the presentations.\r\n\r\nSee the tutorials here:\r\n\r\n* Basic Git: https://speakerdeck.com/laneaasen/basic-git\r\n* Advanced Git: https://speakerdeck.com/laneaasen/advanced-git\r\n* Basic Github: https://speakerdeck.com/laneaasen/basic-github\r\n"}
